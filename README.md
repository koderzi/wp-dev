1. Create new repository by clicking the Use this template button above.
2. Open your duplicated repository in VSCode using the command ">Dev Containers: Clone Repositories in Named Container Volume". You can name your container for easy referencing.
3. (Optional) Enter your git username & email in the terminal.
4. Once the container is ready, you can go to http://localhost:8080/wp-admin to start configuring your WordPress.

## Enable wordpress linting

Disable the built-in VSCode PHP Language Features.

1. Go to Extensions.
2. Search for @builtin php
3. Disable PHP Language Features. Leave PHP Language Basics enabled for syntax highlighting.

## How to include plugin or theme from other repositories

To include a plugin or theme from other repositories, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure the wp-dev container is running.
2. Run the VSCode command ">Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container" then select "/wordpress_web".
3. A new window will appear. Go to source control, click reload if git is not available.
4. Click clone repository to clone your plugin or theme repository to the correct folder:
   - Plugin: /workspaces/your_duplicated_repo/plugins
   - Theme: /workspaces/your_duplicated_repo/themes
5. Then click open to open the cloned repository to start developing.

## Auto-update

By default, auto-updates are enabled for all files and folders excluding files in `configuration`, `plugins` and `themes` folders. This means that you can develop your WordPress plugins and themes, and also save your configuration files, like the workspace configuration file into those folder. This simplifies the process of staying up-to-date with the latest changes and improvements.

To disable auto update, you can find the `init-container.php` file in the `.devcontainer folder` and change the `AUTO_UPDATE` value to `false` at line `3` as follows:

```
   define('AUTO_UPDATE', false);
```

This will prevent automatic updates from occurring.

> Note: Please note that this GitHub template is set up for auto-update, which means that any updates made to the original template repository will be reflected in your duplicated repository automatically. This repository is intended for development purposes only. Do not use it in production environments.
